For the phrase “Java now has regular expressions” evaluate whether the following expressions will find a match:

^Java
\Breg.*
n.w\s+h(a|i)s
s?
s*
s+
s{4}
s{1.}
s{0,3}


^Java : will find the match -> Java : ^ means at the start of 		the line
\Breg.* : won't find the match : \B means non-word boundary but 	regular word comes at start of the word
n.w\s+h(a|i)s : will find the match -> now has

s? : will find the match -> all the blank strings and s'es

s* : will find the match -> all the blank string and 11-12, 26-28, 31-32,

s+ : will find the match -> 11-12, 26-28, 31-32

s{4} : won't find

s{1.} : PatternSystaxException: Unclosed counted closure near 		index 3

s{0,3} : will find match -> all the blank strings and 11-12, 		26-28, 31-32
