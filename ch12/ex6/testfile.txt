Most of the examples so far have shown regular
expressions applied to static strings.
The following example shows one way to apply regular
expressions to search for matches in a file.
Inspired by Unix’s grep, JGrep.java takes two arguments: 
a filename and the regular expression that you want to match.
The output shows each line where a match occurs and the
match position(s) within the line.
